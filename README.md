# FLAME 2026 — Live Neural Network

A small neural network trained in Google Colab:

Celsius → 3 hidden neurons → 1 output neuron → Fahrenheit

## Run locally

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py
```

## Deployment

TensorFlow is used only during training.

The Streamlit application loads learned parameters from `model.json`.

The deployment environment only needs:

- streamlit
- numpy
